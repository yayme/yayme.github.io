  <section class="intro-section">
    <p class="opening">I'm a mathematics and computer science student at KAIST with a background in competitive mathematics and research experience spanning NLP, data science, deep learning, and algorithms. I'm currently interested in quantitative finance because it combines rigorous mathematical modeling with computational efficiency and real market constraints—areas where my experience naturally aligns.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>My foundation in problem-solving comes from competitive mathematics. I competed internationally at the IMO and APMO, earning bronze medals, and also competed in competitive programming. These experiences built my ability to work with complex abstractions under time pressure and to identify patterns in unfamiliar problems.</p>
    
    <p>At KAIST, I focused my coursework on probability theory, mathematical statistics, and machine learning—essentially the mathematical toolkit for working with uncertainty and data-driven systems.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Research & Technical Experience</h2>
    <p>I've worked across several research domains. I started with NLP research at KAIST's Users & Information Lab, where I co-authored a peer-reviewed paper on evaluating LLMs in low-resource languages. This gave me experience with deep learning architectures and model benchmarking at scale.</p>
    
    <p>I then moved to the Institute for Basic Science, working on a Samsung-collaborated project involving time series classification from IoT sensor data. I built CNN, LSTM, and ResNet-based architectures and also studied stochastic processes in biological systems. This was where I started thinking about not just model accuracy but domain adaptations and uncertainty modeling.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, I'm at Huawei in Hong Kong working on state-of-the-art compression algorithms. The work is primarily in C++, focusing on runtime optimization and core model operations—contexts where milliseconds matter. This experience reinforced how important it is to design systems that are both theoretically sound and practically efficient.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Quantitative Finance</h2>
    <p>My interest in quantitative finance developed naturally from this progression. I completed Bloomberg Market Concepts to understand market mechanics and have been working on personal projects—volatility estimation using stochastic differential equations with data assimilation techniques, and alpha signal discovery systems for cryptocurrency markets.</p>
    
    <p>I also competed in the Simon Marais Mathematics Competition and received the Jane Street Prize as the best performer from my university, placing in the top 25% around the globe.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Outside Academics</h2>
    <p>Outside of academics, I'm a competitive chess player—ranked in the top 0.1% on Chess.com with multiple regional tournament wins. I also enjoy strategic board games and psychological thrillers, both in literature and film.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="content-section">
    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>I'm looking for quantitative roles where I can apply mathematical modeling and computational methods to problems with real market feedback. I'm particularly interested in environments with strong technical teams where the quality of your models is directly measurable and where you can iterate quickly based on performance.</p>
